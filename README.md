Code2040 Technical assessment

Part 1:
Connected to the API!

Part 2:
Reversed the string by calling "string"[::-1] on it. Then I posted the string back.

Part 3:
Found the needle in the haystack by using .index()

Part 4:
Utilized .startswith() to find all of the strings that didn't start with the prefix.

Part 5:
Used dateutil.parser to convert the isoString into a datetime object. Then I added the interval number of seconds to it by using
timedelta. Afterwards I converted back into the isoString format using .isoformat() and lastly did a bit of direct manipulation
to get it back to the way it's supposed to be. (With the "Z" on the end)
